# src/simple_llm/pipelines.py
# This file serves as a higher-level orchestrator if needed.
# In this simple example, the training_pipeline function is directly in training.py.
# For larger projects, you might move more complex workflows here.

# Example:
# from simple_llm.training import train_pipeline
# from simple_llm.evaluation import evaluate
# from simple_llm.inference import generate_text # Assuming inference logic was in its own file
#
# def run_full_training_and_eval(model, train_loader, val_loader, ...):
#     train_pipeline(model, train_loader, ...)
#     evaluate(model, val_loader, ...)
#     # Maybe save final report
#
# def run_inference_workflow(model, tokenizer, prompt, ...):
#     generated_text = generate_text(model, tokenizer, prompt, ...)     # Maybe post-process or display result
